## Project Overview

This Excel project provides a detailed analysis of bus breakdowns and delays within New York City. The primary objective was to identify the most common reasons for service disruptions, quantify their impact, and propose actionable recommendations to improve operational efficiency and passenger experience.

This project, accessible via SharePoint, demonstrates proficiency in:
*   **Data Preparation & Aggregation:** Using Excel to clean, organize, and summarize a large dataset of incident reports.
*   **Pivot Table Mastery:** Leveraging pivot tables to dynamically categorize and count delay reasons.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating clear bar charts to visually represent the frequency of different delay causes.
*   **Data-Driven Insights & Recommendations:** Translating analytical findings into practical solutions for operational improvement.

## Key Insights from "Common Delay Reasons" Analysis

The "Common Delay Reasons" worksheet, utilizing a pivot table and a bar chart, provides a clear breakdown of why buses run late or break down:

*   **Overwhelming Dominance of Heavy Traffic:**
    *   **Heavy Traffic** is by far the most significant cause of delays, accounting for a massive **176,196** incidents out of a total of **263,963** (approximately 66.7%). This underscores the profound impact of urban congestion on bus service reliability.
    *   **Recommendation:** Explore strategies such as adjusting bus pick-up times for the majority of students to non-peak traffic hours to mitigate this impact.

*   **Mechanical Issues are a Key Breakdowns Factor:**
    *   While less frequent than traffic, **Mechanical Problems** (13,695 incidents) and **"Won't Start"** issues (1,932 incidents) collectively represent a substantial source of breakdowns, totaling nearly **15,627** incidents. The analysis suggests that "Won't Start" is often a symptom of underlying mechanical issues.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a more rigorous and precautionary maintenance schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly servicing) to proactively address and reduce mechanical failures.

*   **Other Notable Causes:**
    *   "Other" reasons account for 49,135 incidents, suggesting a need for further categorization in data collection.
    *   "Problem Run" (10,193 incidents) also contributes significantly to delays.
    *   Less frequent, but still impactful, causes include Weather Conditions (4,318), Flat Tire (2,401), Late return from Field Trip (2,255), Accident (2,101), and Delayed by School (1,737).

These insights highlight critical areas where operational adjustments and preventative measures can lead to substantial improvements in bus service reliability.

## Methodology & Tools

*   **Tool:** Microsoft Excel (accessed via Microsoft 365 / SharePoint)
*   **Techniques Used:**
    *   **Pivot Tables:** Essential for aggregating and counting delay reasons from raw incident data.
    *   **Bar Charts:** Used to visually compare the frequencies of different delay causes, making the dominant factors immediately apparent.
    *   **Data Cleaning & Filtering:** (Inferred from other sheet names) Preparation of the raw incident data for effective analysis.

## Excel Workbook Structure

The Excel file is well-structured into multiple sheets, providing a comprehensive analysis framework:

*   `Scenario`: Outlines the project's background, objectives, and key questions.
*   `Bus_Breakdown_and_Delays_NYC`: Likely contains the raw or partially processed incident data.
*   `Cleaned Data`: The dataset after undergoing cleaning and standardization processes.
*   `Common Delay Reasons`: The primary sheet showcased, containing the pivot table and bar chart of delay causes, along with findings and recommendations.
*   `Delay Times`: Likely analyzes delays by hour of day or other time-based metrics.
*   `Day of Week`: Investigates delay patterns across different days of the week.
